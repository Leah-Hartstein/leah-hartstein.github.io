                    <h3>Overview</h3>


                    <p><span>F</span>ast fashion is really crazy. It's come to dominate how we buy all our clothes but its really bad for the environment and the people who have to actually make the damn garments. According to a study by whoever it led to lots and lots of carbon emissions and other nasty pollutant stuff.  
 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I tackled this issue as part of a group of four for a course called <em>'Designing for Social Impact'</em> in the first semester of my third year of university, where we were challenged to create a socially-conscious app addressing one of the 16 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we chose goal 16, Responsible Production and Consumption. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After conducting extensive primary and secondary research, we considered several options for creating alternatives to fast fashion before landing on a solution that's novel and a lot of fun: changing the purchasing habits of consumers with an app that challenges them to justify their fast fashion purchases at the point of sale.

                    <p>
                    Though we were working in a very limited timeframe, and only had time to explore solutions on mobile platforms, I'm extremely proud of what we were able to make.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>A</span>fter first forming a group, we spent our first tutorial reading over the full list of 16 UN SDGs and considering issues that we would be able to address within the scope of our eventual final deliverable of a UI prototype. After extensive discussion, we all landed on the idea of exploring fast fashion through UN SDG 12, as we all had a mutual interest in fashion and all shared the experience of making too many impulse purchases. We then split up responsibilities for our research. I volunteered to do most of the secondary research, since I'm pretty skilled in it from my previous degree. Primary research was split between my other three group members, with each choosing to do interviews, surveys and online ethnography, respectively.</p>
                    
                    <p>We found a remarkable thread of insights across all of our research methods. I was somewhat aware of the issues with fast fashion, but I still found my secondary research into reports from NGOs and other fashion industry researchers to be quite shocking. Essentially: Fast fashion is horrifically bad for the environment, responsible for [number] of carbon waste annually and [percentage] of carbon emissions. Production is spread across the entire world, with it being extremely common for a garment to pass through several different countries in its production process before final retail sale to first-world consumers. Surveys of consumers find this to be pretty common knowledge for the general public and polls show widespread knowledge of the flaws of the production process. However, this awareness does not greatly influence consumer purchases because consumers operate under very limited knowledge and do not trust more expensive 'sustainably-made' brands to be significantly better.</p>
                
                        <p>
                        After collating the primary research conducted by my groupmembers with an affinity diagram, we found it correlated very strongly with the insights from my secondary research. [something from interviews and stuff idk]. We knew from this that addressing fast fashion by selling more sustainable clothes is not enough of a solution, and some sort of intervention to just simply make consumers by less clothes is necessary.    
                        </p>
                        <p>We synthesised all of our findings into an affinity diagram (which can be seen <a href ="https://www.figma.com/board/VciKVrWxbcfPlPQ1aN7umM/affinity-diagram?node-id=0-1&t=mP7UaF5iOyfqABuT-1">here.</a>), and a single problem statement to orient our design moving forward:
                        </p>
                        <em class = "problemstatement">While most consumers are aware of the social, environmental, and ethical challenges posed by fast fashion, their capacity to adopt more sustainable practices is constrained by time and budget.</em></centered>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
<p><span>W</span>ith a strong idea for the shape of our potential solution, each group member was tasked with coming up with an original idea for a potential solution, targeted at people like us: fashion-conscious consumers under the age of 30. 
</p>
<p>We landed on three proposed solutions: 
    <ul>
        <li>'Sewlution', an app to suggest repairs and alterations for already-owned clothes.</li>
        <li>'The People's Wardobe', a system of communal wardrobe rental.</li>
        <li>My idea, 'SSHAME', an app and browser extension that confronts the user at the point of sale and challenges them to list times they will actually wear the garment.</li>
    </ul>
     </p>
    
     <p>After comparing all three ideas with a decision matrix, ranking each on criteria  the winner was SSHAME, as we concluded that it was the most novel, most focused on causing positive behavioural shifts, and the easiest to show with a figma prototype.</li>

          <div class = "text">          <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
            <p><span>W</span>ith almost entirely positive feedback from my tutor I felt very confident going into my final prototype. The only real work left was to actually make the thing</p>
            <p>First, I expanded my initial notes out to a 2600 word draft where I told the complete story in a rigorous journalistic style, which I then combined with my initial diagrams to create a written 'prototype' that I was able to test on my friends and family.
            My participants were asked to review the text, answer a few brief interview questions concerning the content, then provide feedback overall. Since 2600 words ended up being pretty far over the limit, I also told them to identify any areas where cuts could be made. All of my participants really loved the text and only made minor suggestions for cuts.</p>
            <p>I then had to make the website itself. My layout was pretty simple, so most of the HTML and CSS was not very difficult. Most of the difficulty was in the Plotly charts, in particular the two tracking theft numbers.</p>
            <p>Once I had the page mostly ready, I did a final round of testing with a different group of four friends. My participants were instructed to complete brief think-aloud tests, describing their thoughts as they read through the site, then complete a brief semi-structured interview concerning each chart in detail. The feedback was also overwhelmingly positive, but my participants raised a few concerns about the legibility and interactivity of the charts - some, like the google trend charts, were hard to read and required clearer colours and more labels, while others had strange behaviours resulting from hardcoded features in the Plotly.JS suite that would need to be removed.</p>
            <p>The final submission deadline was soon approaching to I tried to address as much of the feedback as I could, and managed to do almost all of it. I submitted about two hours before the due date. My final site received very positive feedback and a high distinction grade of 90%, with the only real criticism being that I'd considerably exceeded the wordcount. </p>
