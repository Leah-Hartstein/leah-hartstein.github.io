                    <h3>Overview</h3>


                    <p><span>F</span>ast fashion is really crazy. It's come to dominate how we buy all our clothes but its really bad for the environment and the people who have to actually make the damn garments. According to a study by whoever it led to lots and lots of carbon emissions and other nasty pollutant stuff.  
 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I tackled this issue as part of a group of four for a course called <em>'Designing for Social Impact'</em> in the first semester of my third year of university, where we were challenged to create a socially-conscious app addressing one of the 16 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we chose goal 16, Responsible Production and Consumption. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We considered several options for creating alternatives to fast fashion before landing on a solution that's novel and a lot of fun: changing the purchasing habits of consumers with an app that challenges them to justify their fast fashion purchases at the point of sale.

                    <p>
                    Though we were working in a very limited timeframe, and only had time to explore solutions on mobile platforms, I'm extremely proud of what we were able to make.

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    <span>A</span>fter first forming a group, we spent our first tutorial reading over the full list of 16 UN SDGs and considering issues that we would be able to address within the scope of our eventual final deliverable of a UI prototype. After extensive discussion, we all landed on the idea of exploring fast fashion through UN SDG 12, as we all had a mutual interest in fashion and all shared the experience of making too many impulse purchases. We then split up responsibilities for our research. I volunteered to do most of the secondary research, since I'm pretty skilled in it from my previous degree. Primary research was split between my other three group members, with each choosing to do interviews, surveys and online ethnography, respectively.</p>
                    
                    <p>We found a remarkable thread of insights across all of our research methods. I was somewhat aware of the issues with fast fashion, but I still found my secondary research into reports from NGOs and other fashion industry researchers to be quite shocking. Essentially: Fast fashion is horrifically bad for the environment, responsible for [number] of carbon waste annually and [percentage] of carbon emissions. Production is spread across the entire world, with it being extremely common for a garment to pass through several different countries in its production process before final retail sale to first-world consumers. Surveys of consumers find this to be pretty common knowledge for the general public and polls show widespread knowledge of the flaws of the production process. However, this awareness does not greatly influence consumer purchases because consumers operate under very limited knowledge and do not trust more expensive 'sustainably-made' brands to be significantly better.</p>
                
                        <p>
                        After collating the primary research conducted by my groupmembers with an affinity diagram, we found it correlated very strongly with the insights from my secondary research. [something from interviews and stuff idk]. We knew from this that addressing fast fashion by selling more sustainable clothes is not enough of a solution, and some sort of intervention to just simply make consumers by less clothes is necessary.    
                        </p>
                        <p>We synthesised all of our findings into an affinity diagram (which can be seen <a href ="https://www.figma.com/board/VciKVrWxbcfPlPQ1aN7umM/affinity-diagram?node-id=0-1&t=mP7UaF5iOyfqABuT-1">here.</a>), and a single problem statement to orient our design moving forward:
                        </p>
                        <em class = "problemstatement">While most consumers are aware of the social, environmental, and ethical challenges posed by fast fashion, their capacity to adopt more sustainable practices is constrained by time and budget.</em></centered>

            <h3>Ideation</h3>
<p><span>W</span>ith a strong idea for the shape of our potential solution, each group member was tasked with coming up with an original idea for a potential solution, targeted at people like us: fashion-conscious consumers under the age of 30. 
</p>
<p>We landed on three proposed solutions: 
    <ul>
        <li>'Sewlution', an app to suggest repairs and alterations for already-owned clothes.</li>
        <li>'The People's Wardobe', a system of communal wardrobe rental.</li>
        <li>My idea, 'SSHAME', an app and browser extension that confronts the user at the point of sale and challenges them to list times they will actually wear the garment.</li>
    </ul>
     </p>
    
     <p>We then compared our three ideas with a decision matrix, ranking each on how they address core user needs, the winner was SSHAME, as we concluded that it was the most novel, most focused on causing positive behavioural shifts, and the easiest to show with a figma prototype.</li>

I did sketches to flesh out my initial idea into a basic UI flow, in the form of an app overlay that slides over other fashion apps when a purchase is about to be made. To incentivise further engagement, the user can also catalogue their wardobe in the app, and see purchases made by friends. 
             </p>   
            <p>Then Kira did some wireframes! Our initial focus was just on establishing the full scope of the app, so the focus was mostly on the design and page layout, and a set of core features. We initially considered more of a social network sort of thing. IDK.
