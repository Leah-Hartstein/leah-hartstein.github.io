            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi! I'm Leah. I'm a recent graduate of a Batchelor of Design at the University of Sydney, majoring in Interaction Design.</p>
            <p>My degree taught me a whole bunch of different stuff, but I'm most interested in UI and Web Design. A lot of designers have lofty ideas about changing the world with their products, but I don't. I just love the challenge and thought involved in guiding users through an interface and slightly improving a real product for real, ordinary users. </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I like to make dance music and rap beats in my little home studio. For the last thirteen years I have been producing music electronically, creating Dance, Hiphop and Grime music as well as
                performing as a DJ at live performances and on radio sets. As of 2025, I've released nine solo EPs, five EPs with
                collaborators as well as 10+ singles, released on labels in the UK, USA and Australia. My productions have been played on the
                BBC, Apple Beats Radio, as well as FBi in Sydney. I haven't blown up, yet, but I've made an amazing group of friends across the world that have pushed me to try harder, learn more about myself, and develop as an artist.</p>
            <p>Other than that - I'm trans! It's pretty great. </p>
